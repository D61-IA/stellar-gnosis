### Folder Contents

This folder hosts Python scripts that we use but are not part of
the website.

Example of scripts include those written for processing data before
uploading to the DB or pulling data from remote servers, e.g.,
the latest papers from arXiv.org.

### import_csv.py
This script takes csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers,
processes them and uploads data to the Postgres database used by Gnosis.
